# Flag Cleanup

The Flag Cleanup plugin wraps the [uber/piranha](https://github.com/uber/piranha/blob/master/POLYGLOT_README.md#polyglot-piranha) feature flag cleanup tool.

## Getting Started Guide
To get started creating flag cleanup prs via pipelines and writing your own custom rules see our [getting started guide](docs/README.md).

## Build
Build the image with the following command:
```
make image
```

This will generate a local docker image named _harness/flag_cleanup:latest_ .
